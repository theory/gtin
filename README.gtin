GTIN Data Type 0.01
===================

This distribution creates a custom PostgreSQL data type, the GTIN. GTINs are
bar codes used to identify products. The GTIN specification is a superset of
the UPC and EAN bar code formats with which you may already be familiar, and
which will just work with the GTIN data type.
